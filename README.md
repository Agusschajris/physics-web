Features to add:

✔ button to decide if the graph includes negative values

✔ velocity graph for constant acceleration

☐ physics memes page (from pinterest)

☐ display complete functions with the inserted values

☐ section that shows the value of time or position/velocity according to a specific value of time or position/velocity

☐ section to solve for unknown variables (ex: want to know initial velocity knowing other data)
